    "- It is often Useful to measure objects not in terms of their quantity but in terms of some quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We frequently represent qualitative information in categories such as gender, colors, or brand of cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, not all categorical data is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sets of categories with no intrinsic ordering are called *nominal* . Example of nominal categories include:\n",
    "    - Blue, Red, Green\n",
    "    - Man, Woman\n",
    "    - BMW, Escalade, Mercedez\n",
    "\n",
    "- In contrast, when a set of categories has some natural ordering, we refer to it as *ordinal*. Eg.\n",
    "    - Low, Medium, High\n",
    "    - Young, Old\n",
    "    - Agree, Neutral, Disagree\n",
    "\n",
    "- Categorical information is often represented in data as a vector or column of strings. The problem is that most machine learning \n",
    "algorithm require inputs to be numerical values.\n"
